	<p>It has long been said that dog's are man's best friends!<strong> From their playfulness, loyalty, and cuteness it is easy to see why!</strong> There are so many reasons
	why dogs have been deemed "Man's Best Friend," and some of these reasons can be seen in this article
	<a href="http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/10-reasons-why-dogs-are-mans-best-friend.html">here!</a> I personally have had a dog my entire life, and I do not think my chilhood would
	have been the sane without her. She would greet me each day when I got off the bus, run around and play with me in the backyard, and was always there to watch TV with me if I wanted. To me 
	and my family, it was as if my dog, Lucy, was not just our pet but another family member.

	<p> There are many different reasons why people love dogs so much, and why they make great pets. First off, whenever you come home your dog always greets with you the same 
	enthusiasm each time. Your dog is always wanting to play, love on you, and willing to give you its full attention. Dogs also seem to be able to sense when you are upset or 
	sad, and in turn try to play with you to cheer you up. They never seem to have a bad day, or hold a grude and overall doga are just a loveable and loyal companion.</p>
