	<p> There are many different reasons why people love dogs so much, and why they make great pets. First off, whenever you come home your dog always greets with you the same 
	enthusiasm each time. Your dog is always wanting to play, love on you, and willing to give you its full attention. Dogs also seem to be able to sense when you are upset or 
	sad, and in turn try to play with you to cheer you up. They never seem to have a bad day, or hold a grude and overall doga are just a loveable and loyal companion.
