		<h3>The Golden Ginkgo</h3>
		<p>
		The ginkgo <span STYLE="font-style: italic">(Ginkgo biloba)</span> is a medium-sized tree native to the Orient, but widely planted in
		the Southestern US. The ginkgo is considered a “living fossil,”in that there are no closely
		related species still extant. Ginkgos are prized for their vivid yellow fall leaves.
		<p>
		An unusual biological feature of the ginkgo is that it is a gymnosperm (“naked seed”),
		meaning that the ginkgo seed is not encased in a fruit. In this the ginkgo resembles pine trees, 
		although the ginkgo is deciduous (loses its leaves in the winter).
		<p>
		Ginkgos can be extremely long lived; one ginkgo in Shandong province, China is estimated 
		to be 3,000 years old.
